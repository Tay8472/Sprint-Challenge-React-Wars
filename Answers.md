1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS creates a more effective way to write DOM by simply giving the illusion that you are writing HTML. This also makes it easier for hundreds of people or a ton of data to a be modifying at the same time with less impact on cache or server load.

1. Describe component state.

The component state is the default state that your component can be in, this can be anything, true, false, or a number once you set it within your code, but is required to adiquately run specific components.

1. Describe props.

Props are properties that can be technically assigned and passed to other javascript components, kind of like a gateway for array or object properties to be accessed in multiple components.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

Side effects are mainly creating events to trigger depening on the code you put inside, for example a regular side effect with a console.log will trigger every time something changes, or you can set a side effect to trigger only once, which is why its useful when accessing API data.
